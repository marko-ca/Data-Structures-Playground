# Data Structures in C++

Are you interested in mastering data structures in C++? Look no further! This repository is your comprehensive guide to various data structures implemented in C++. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced programmer wanting to refresh your knowledge, you'll find clear and well-documented C++ code files for a wide range of data structures. Explore, learn, and use these data structures to supercharge your coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find C++ implementations of various data structures, each organized into its dedicated directory. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented, and efficient code for each data structure, making it easy for you to learn, understand, and use them in your projects.

## Available Data Structures

1. **[Array](Array/)**: An implementation of dynamic arrays in C++.
2. **[Singly Linked List](SinglyLinkedList/)**: An implementation of Singly Linked List in C++.
3. **[Doubly Linked List](DoublyLinkedList/)**: Doubly linked list implementations.
4. **[Stack](Stack/)**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
5. **[Queue](Queue/)**: Implementation of a queue data structure.
6. **[Binary Search Tree](BinarySearchTree/)**: Binary search tree (BST) implementations.
7. **[Heap](Heap/)**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
8. **[Hash Table](HashTable/)**: Implementation of a hash table using open addressing.
9. **[Graph](Graph/)**: Graph data structure and traversal algorithms.

## Getting Started

Each data structure directory contains a `'name'.cpp` file showcasing how to use the implemented data structure. Simply navigate to the directory of your choice, compile the code, and explore its functionality.
